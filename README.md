**Machine Learning Project**
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting heating and cooling loads based on various features. The dataset used in this project is from the ENB2012 Data, which includes energy consumption data for buildings.

The project explores different machine learning models and evaluates their performance using metrics such as MAE (Mean Absolute Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and R².

**Features**
The dataset includes the following features:

X1 - X8: Various features related to building characteristics (e.g., insulation, building type, orientation, etc.)

Y1: Heating Load (target variable for prediction)

Y2: Cooling Load (target variable for prediction)

Models Used
This project implements the following machine learning models:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

Evaluation Metrics
The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Measures the average magnitude of errors in predictions.

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Measures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and true values.

R² (Coefficient of Determination): Indicates how well the model fits the data (higher values indicate better fit).
